Three characters-
First- Person who is lazy and carefree, just wants to have fun
Second- Person who wants to make sure things are kept under control, does not like first person's carefree attitude
Third- Player character worried about the arguments of the first two, is given conflicting instructions and the like

Ongoing argument in roughly 5 parts-
1- Beginning of argument, second person gives player tasks, before trying to calm down the first
2- first and second are arguing
3- second gives player more tasks that were forgotten
4- arguing
5- final arguing before party, argument put aside so the party can start

Argument ideas-

Arguing over state of room (first person not picking up, second person being too strict)
Arguing over what to do at the party (first wants to go all out, second wants to try not to be too crazy)
Arguing over assignment worked on between the two (first person leaving things to the last second, second person being too hung up over things...?)
Arguing over first person's day (first person is whining about how bad things are, second person doesn't at least try to help first person feel better)

Argument chosen- argument over party (makes the most sense, fits in with what's going on, could possibly make the second list of tasks from the other person who doesn't give the first list)

Outline of argument:

Starts in the middle with something like "can we at least agree on this much", gives list of tasks to player, no option for player input yet, starts building anxiety
First person mentions wanting to bring alcohol, second is freaking out over it, input is asked
	Choices: Allow alcohol, recommend a substitute, enforce limitations on alcohol
	Allowing alcohol angers second person, raises anxiety massively
	Recommending a substitute angers first person slightly, raises anxiety slightly
	Enforcing limitations is a minor compromise, lowers anxiety slightly
Second list of tasks is given by first person, apology for being late and being unable to get it done himself, which causes second person to call him out on it; phrasing of this should change based off of previous choice...? (though game document says otherwise)
Arguing about how lazy first person is, second person is being called out for being controlling, chance to interject
	Choices: Remind both about the party, say they're being ridiculous, just ignore them
	Reminding them about the party will get them to at least calm down, lowers anxiety slightly
	Saying they're being ridiculous just gets them angry at you, raises anxiety massively
	Ignoring them will have them just keep going at it, raises anxiety moderately
Party is about to start and they're still arguing a bit, but they realize the party is about to start, so they give it a break to start the party

Endings:

Get overly stressed- You give up on the party, and thus can't really enjoy yourself at it.
Does not get overly anxious but runs out of time- The party still happens, you at least get told you did your best and the first person apologizes for putting so much on you
Does not get overly anxious and finishes everything- The party goes well, you're thanked for your help, gain a bit of confidence in being able to control your anxiety
